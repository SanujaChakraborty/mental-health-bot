# Mental Health Chatbot using DASS-21 (Academic Project)

## Overview
This repository contains an academic project developed as part of my M.Tech
(AI & Data Science) coursework, focusing on mental health assessment using
the DASS-21 questionnaire and a prototype chatbot interface.

The objective was to understand how structured questionnaire data can be
processed, analyzed, and integrated into an AI-driven conversational system
for educational purposes.

## About DASS-21
DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale) is a standardized psychological
questionnaire widely used for research and screening purposes.

## Project Components
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Score computation based on DASS-21 guidelines
- Rule-based / logic-driven chatbot prototype
- Exploratory analysis of questionnaire responses

## Project Structure
```
project_chatbot1.py # Core chatbot logic
project_chatbot2.py # Alternative chatbot flow

```

> Raw and cleaned datasets are excluded from this repository to maintain
data privacy and ethical standards.

## Learnings
- Handling structured survey data
- Feature engineering from questionnaire responses
- Ethical considerations in AI for healthcare
- Designing conversational flows

## Limitations
- Educational prototype only
- Not clinically validated
- Limited dataset
- No real-time deployment

## Ethical Disclaimer
This project is intended strictly for academic and educational purposes.
It is NOT a medical diagnostic tool and should not be used for clinical decisions.

## Future Improvements
- Use fully anonymized or synthetic datasets
- Incorporate explainable AI techniques
- Add model-based risk classification
- Improve conversational UX
